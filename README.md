Scary-Pop-Up
============

This is the classic "scary pop-ups" with a twist. Users will think they are solving a puzzle, but with a wrong click, they actually enable the scary pop-up.

I plan to add some extra fun. For example:
A phony scare-o-meter that measures how scared you became + heart rate.
A phony picture of "the victim" and how he/she "looked" when the scare popped up.
There will be several phony pictures, each appearing randomly.
Possibly a better design for the game and another phony puzzle.
Would like to remove the alert boxes.
Add a PLAY button for further trickery.


Feel free to join, and thank you!
